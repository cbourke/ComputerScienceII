# Canvas Support Management

## Where do I go for help with Canvas?

Canvas is UNL's Learning Management System (LMS) available at
<https://canvas.unl.edu>.  For technical support see
<https://services.unl.edu/service/learning-management-system-lms-canvas-unl>

# Eclipse & Java

You may use any Integrated Development Environment you wish, but instructions
and support for this course will be limited to the Eclipse IDE.  If you choose
to use a different IDE, you will need to make adjustments accordingly so that
your code, artifacts, and submissions still work as expected.

## Installation

  - You'll first need to install the Java Developer Kit (JDK):  
    <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/>  
    This is *not* the same thing as "Java" (which is usually the JRE or
    Java Runtime Environment); the JDK is necessary to *develop* in Java.

  - Install the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE):  
    <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>

# Linux Server

You have access to a (SUSE) linux server hosted at `cse-linux-01.unl.edu`.  You
can login to this server using SSH (Secure Shell) using your Canvas login and
password.  Your Canvas login will look something like `cbourke3`; it is *not*
your NUID.
