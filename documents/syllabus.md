## University Policies, Resources & Services

Students are responsible for knowing the university policies and
resources found on this page: https://go.unl.edu/coursepolicies

## Skills Objectives

Throughout the duration of this course, you will be presented with a lot
of information, some of which will have immediate application and some
whose importance is not immediately apparent. As a different measure of
your success in this course, by the end, you should have the following
skills.

-   Be able to more easily pick up and learn a new programming language
    on your own

-   Be able to recognize, use, design and appreciate programs with an
    object-oriented flavor

-   Be able to design a database-backed application from scratch given a
    general problem statement

-   Be able to understand and implement basic data structures as well as
    recognize how and when to leverage appropriate simple data
    structures

-   Be able to identify and analyze basic algorithms

Overall, CS2 is a continuation of CS1. At the end of a typical CS1
course, you should be able to approach a reasonably complex problem,
design a top-down solution, and code a program in a high-level
programming language. By the end of this course your approach to problem
solving should be modified to ask and answer design questions first:

-   What entities/objects would be appropriate to model this problem?

-   How would these objects interact to solve the problem?

-   What data structures would be the most appropriate or efficient to
    use?

## Tentative Topics

-   Introduction to Java / Python (Honors section)

-   Object-Oriented Programming, OOP in Java

-   Database Design, SQL, Database Connectivity, multi-tier
    design

-   Lists (array-based, linked; circular doubly-linked), Stacks & Queues

-   Algorithm Analysis, Recursion, Searching & Sorting

-   Trees; Binary Search Trees

## Course Format & Delivery

This course is offered in multiple sections. The main offering has
two sections:
  * Section 150 is the in-person lecture with lectures livestreamed via
    YouTube.  Recordings of the lecture are available immediately after.
  * Section 700 is the online section.  Students enrolled in this section may
    attend virtually by watching the livestream and utilizing either YouTube
    chat or our online forum Piazza to ask questions.  Students in the online
    section may "attend" *any* lab section virtually via zoom.  A substantial
    set of pre-prepared video tutorials and lectures is also available for
    students wishing to work asynchronously.
  * Section 810 is an online section offered through the
    [Nebraska Now](https://admissions.unl.edu/specialized-information/nebraska-now/)
    program.
  * There are two smaller separate honors sections for CSCE 156H (sections
    150 and 700) with the same format as the main sections.  Generally, the
    there are higher expectations (each assignment has 10-15% extra work
    required for the honors section) and we do go a bit faster in order to
    cover some extra topics as time permits.

### Labs

Students in in-person sections may choose to attend their lab section either
in-person or remotely (via zoom).  Students in the online 700 section will
complete their labs remotely but may attend any lab sessions virtually via
zoom.  

### Office Hours

All office hours by instructors and Learning Assistants will be offered
both in-person in the School of Computing
[Student Resource Center](https://computing.unl.edu/current-undergraduate#SRC)
as well as online via zoom.  

### Continuation of Instruction

If in-person classes are canceled by the University during a lecture
day, lecture will still be livestreamed.  If in-person classes are canceled
by the University during a lab/hack day, in-person attendance will not be
required, help will be made available via zoom and you will still be
expected to complete the work remotely.

## Assessment

Assessment (grading) will be based on labs and assignments.  There are 14 labs,
20 points each.  They are graded based on completion and your lowest lab
grade will be dropped.  The vast majority of your assessment will be based
on assignments whose point values vary.  To start you out on the right foot,
you have been awarded 15 free starter points.  You are currently earning an
A in this course; keep it up!

| Category    | Number | Points |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Starter Pts | 1      |   15   |
| Labs        | 13     |  260   |
| Assignments | 9      |  975   |
| Total       |        | 1250   |

The honor section point distribution is similar but there are more total points
due to additional required points on the assignments.

### Scale

Final letter grades will be awarded based on the following standard
scale. This scale may be adjusted upwards if the instructor deems it
necessary based on the final grades only. No scale will be made for
individual assignments.

| Letter Grade | Percent |
|--------------|---------|
| A+           | >= 97%  |
| A            | >= 93%  |
| A-           | >= 90%  |
| B+           | >= 87%  |
| B            | >= 83%  |
| B-           | >= 80%  |
| C+           | >= 77%  |
| C            | >= 73%  |
| C-           | >= 70%  |
| D+           | >= 67%  |
| D            | >= 63%  |
| D-           | >= 60%  |
| F            | < 60%   |

### Labs

There are weekly labs that give you hands-on exercises for topics
recently covered in lecture. The purpose of lab is not only to give you
further working experience with lecture topics, but also to provide you
with additional information and details not necessarily covered in
lecture. Each lab will come with some starter code and exercises that
you have to complete.  You will submit your code as specified through
the webhandin and we will grade your lab using the webgrader.

Labs are setup as a *peer programming* experience. If you are attending
lab *in person*, you may be randomly paired with a partner. One of you
will be the *driver* and the other will be the *navigator*. The navigator
will be responsible for reading the instructions and guiding the driver.
The driver will be in charge of the keyboard and will type the code. Both
driver and navigator are responsible for developing and working through
solutions *together*.  Neither the navigator nor the driver is "in charge."
This is an equal collaboration and all efforts should be equally shared.
Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged to help and interact
and with other pairs in the lab.  If you are attending lab remotely or
online, you may be paired up with another person virtually if you choose
or you may complete the lab on your own.

### Assignments

There are 8 assignments as well as a design document. Assignments will
be due 1 second before midnight Friday evening the week that they are
due. Code and other relevant *artifacts* must be submitted using
webhandin unless otherwise stated. If there are written portions of the
homework, they should be typed. You should
typeset code snippets using a monotype font (Courier for example) for
readability. Figures may be hand drawn, but you are encouraged to use
some sort of software to render them.

In this course, most of the assignments build on prior assignments.
Therefore, it is **extremely important** for you to stay on task and not
fall behind with assignments. You should start on assignments early and
resolve any and all issues (bugs, design flaws) as soon as possible so
they do not carry over to the next assignment.

### 15th Week Policy Notification

A per UNL’s 15th Week Policy (available here:
<https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-standards/policies/fifteenth-week-policy/>)
we are required to serve written notice that the final assignment as
well as the final lab will be due during the 15th week or "dead week."

### Grading Policy

If you have questions about grading or believe that points were deducted
unfairly, you must first address the issue with the individual who
graded it to see if it can be resolved. Such questions should be made
within a reasonable amount of time after the graded assignment has been
returned. No further consideration will be given to any assignment a
week after it grades have been posted. It is important to emphasize that
the goal of grading is consistency. A grade on any given assignment,
even if it is low for the entire class, should not matter that much.
Rather, students who do comparable work should receive comparable grades
(see the subsection on the scale used for this course).

### Late Work Policy

In general, there will be no make-up or late work accepted.
Exceptions may be made in certain circumstances such as health or
emergency, but you must make every effort to get prior permission.
Documentation may also be required.

Homework assignments have a strict due date/time as defined by the CSE
server’s system clock. All program files must be handed in using
webhandin as specified in individual assignment handouts. Programs that
are even a few seconds past the due date/time will be considered late
and you will be locked out of handing anything in after that time.

### Webgrader Policy

Failure to adhere to the requirements of an assignment in such a manner
that makes it impossible to grade your program via the webgrader means
that a disproportionate amount of time would be spent evaluating your
assignment. For this reason, we will not grade any assignment that does
not compile and run through the webgrader.

### Academic Integrity

All homework assignments, programs, and exams must represent your own
work unless otherwise stated. No collaboration with fellow students,
past or current, is allowed unless otherwise permitted on specific
assignments or problems. The School of Computing has an
[Academic Integrity Policy](https://computing.unl.edu/academic-integrity-policy/).
All students enrolled in any School of Computing course are bound by this policy. You are expected
to read, understand, and follow this policy. Violations will be dealt
with on a case by case basis and may result in a failing assignment or a
failing grade for the course itself.

## Honors Section

For those in the Honors section of this course topics will be covered at
a faster pace so that additional "advanced" topics can also be covered.

In addition, each assignment may contain additional requirements or
problems that must be completed. There may also be additional
assignments. Bottom line, there will be higher expectations with regard
to the quality and quantity of work in this course compared to the
regular section. As a student in this course, you will be expected to
meet or exceed those expectations which may require more of your time
and a more proactive approach to studying and greater diligence in
completely assignments.

## Communication & Getting Help

The primary means of communication for this course is Piazza, an online
forum system designed for college courses. We have established a Piazza
group for this course and you should have received an invitation to
join. If you have not, contact the instructor immediately. With Piazza
you can ask questions anonymously, remain anonymous to your classmates,
or choose to be identified. Using this open forum system the entire
class benefits from the instructor and TA responses. In addition, you
and other students can also answer each other’s questions (again you may
choose to remain anonymous or identify yourself to the instructors or
everyone). You may still email the instructor or TAs, but more than
likely you will be redirected to Piazza for help.

In addition, there are is an [anonymous suggestion box](https://computing.unl.edu/anonymous-department-feedback-form/)
that you may use to voice your concerns about any problems in the course if you do not
wish to be identified.

### Learning Assistant Program (LAP)

This course is supported by the CSE Learning Assistant Program (LAP).  
The mission of the LAP is to improve student comprehension and
retention in computing fields by focusing on the learner's experience.
This course will be supplemented by Learning Assistants (LAs) and Course
Leaders (CLs) to help improve your learning. LAs and CLs are other
undergraduate students who have taken the same or similar courses
and have been trained to help you succeed in this course. Your LAs
and CLs will hold regular office hours, help with grading, and assist
you with labs/assignments.

I strongly encourage you to utilize the LAs and CLs when you are
completing coursework. More information can be found in the Learning
Assistant Program Module on Canvas.

### UNL Writing Center

The Writing Center can provide you with meaningful support as you write for
this class as well as other courses. Trained undergraduate
and graduate peer consultants are available to talk with you about all forms
of communication. You are welcome to bring in everything from lab reports,
presentations, and research papers to cover letters, application essays, and
graduate theses and dissertations. Writing Center Consultants can work with
you at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming and organizing
your ideas through polishing a final draft.

There are three ways you can connect with a Consultant:

* Online (a real-time, video conversation)
* eTutoring (email feedback)
* In person in Andrews 102

### Getting Help

Your success in this course is ultimately your responsibility. Your
success in this course depends on how well you utilize the opportunities
and resources that we provide. There are numerous outlets for learning
the material and getting help in this course:

-   Lectures: attend lectures regularly and when you do use the time
    appropriately. Do not distract yourself with social media or other
    time wasters. Actively take notes (electronic or hand written). It
    is well-documented that good note taking directly leads to
    understanding and retention of concepts.

-   Lecture Videos: Lecture videos are intended as a supplement that
    mirrors lecture material but that may not cover everything. Watch
    them at your own pace on a regular basis for reiteration or in case
    you missed something in lecture.

-   Required Reading: do the required reading on a regular basis. The
    readings provide additional details and depth that you may not
    necessarily get directly in lecture.

-   Labs: use your time during labs wisely. Engage with your lab
    instructors, teaching assistants, your partner(s) and other
    students. Be sure to adequately prepare for labs by reading the
    handouts before coming to lab. Get started and don’t get distracted.

-   Piazza: if you have questions ask them on Piazza. It is the best and
    likely fastest way to get help with your questions. Also, be sure to
    read other student’s posts and questions and feel free to answer
    yourself!

-   Office Hours & Student Resource Center: the instructor and teaching
    assistants hold regular office hours throughout the week as posted
    on the course website. Attend office hours if you have questions or
    want to review material. The [Student Resource Center](http://cse.unl.edu/src)
    is open Monday through Friday. Even if your TAs
    are not scheduled during that time, there are plenty of other TAs
    and students present that may be able to help. And, you may be able
    to help others!

-   Don’t procrastinate. The biggest reason students fail this course is
    because they do not give themselves enough opportunities to learn
    the material. Don’t wait to the last minute to start your
    assignments. Many people wait to the last minute and flood the TAs
    and SRC, making it difficult to get help as the due date approaches.
    Don’t underestimate how much time your assignment(s) will take and
    don’t wait to the week before hand to get started. Ideally, you
    should be working on the problems as we are covering them.

-   Get help in the *right way*: when you go to the instructor or TA for
    help, you must demonstrate that you have put forth a good faith
    effort toward understanding the material. Asking questions that
    clearly indicate you have failed to read the required material, have
    not been attending lecture, etc. is *not acceptable*. Don’t ask
    generic questions like "I’m lost, I don’t know what I’m doing".
    Instead, explain what you have tried so far. Explain why you think
    what you have tried doesn’t seem to be working. Then the TA will
    have an easier time to help you identify misconceptions or problems.
    This is known as "Rubber Duck Debugging" where in if you try to
    explain a problem to someone (or, lacking a live person, a rubber
    duck), then you can usually identify the problem yourself. Or, at
    the very least, get some insight as to what might be wrong.
