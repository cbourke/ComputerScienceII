# Overview

The instructor sets policies in the syllabus which all students are
expected to read, understand and adhere to. Every Course Leader (CL) and
Learning Assistant (LA) is expected to read, understand and also follow
these policies. Often, students will attempt to violate these policies
or ask for special consideration. Do not speculate or otherwise discuss
possible exceptions to these policies. Direct them to the instructor and
follow up with the instructor if necessary.

-   Be prepared. Be aware of the course content and expectations. You
    are responsible for knowing the material so that you can effectively
    explain, demonstrate and guide students. Be able to complete the
    assignments, labs, etc. yourself. If you have doubts or concerns
    engage with a Course Leader or other LA. If you cannot resolve the
    issue, ask the instructor for clarification.

-   Manage your time. You have made a commitment to this course and will
    be expected to fulfill it. Work and plan ahead. Be aware of upcoming
    due dates in this course as well as your own courses, research,
    personal obligations, etc. Plan ahead and make appropriate
    accommodations if you know there will be an excess of work during a
    period of time.

## Course Structure

This course is a historically large enrollment course with multiple
sections. Despite the size, it is our goal to foster a greater sense of
community among these students in our department and in our discipline.

In addition to a traditional lecture, we've produced dozens of
lecture/tutorial videos for students to view before and/or after
lecture. Lectures are livestreamed and recordings are also made
available. We have extensive required reading (mostly from my free
textbook but also supplemental resources).

During the weekly labs, students may be randomly paired up and expected
to complete several peer programming exercises. They are expected to
complete the labs in the lab time and are graded only on completion.

The course is structured such that each assignment is a phase in an
overall project. The topic and specifics change from semester to
semester, but each has the same basic structure of iteratively building
a full database-backed application. Each phase is due on Fridays at
midnight. Preceding each phase, students submit a design document draft
that will be evaluated and returned to them for improvements. The design
document serves several purposes including giving students an early
experience in technical writing, providing an impetus for an early
initial design phase, and to keep students on track and thinking about
the project as a whole.

## General Responsibilities

**Learning Assistants** will have several responsibilities in addition
to the responsibilities and expectations of the Learning Assistant
Program (LAP).

-   Assisting in weekly lab sessions

-   Grading (assignments and design document drafts)

-   Mentoring and helping students in *help* hours and online via Piazza

-   General administrative duties (entering grades, paperwork, etc.) as
    needed

-   Other duties may include course development, materials development
    (solution keys, grading scripts, test cases, future exercises, etc.)
    and other tasks identified by the instructor.

**Course Leaders** will have the following general responsibilities

-   Supervising lab sessions and assisting students in them

-   Supervise grading and ensure that all assignments are graded in a
    timely manner, shifting of responsibilities when issues arise, and
    ensuring quality and consistency in grading

-   Holding regular *help* hours in the designated area for the course

-   Be in regular communication and attend weekly coordinating meetings
    with the instructor

# Communication

-   Piazza is our primary means of communication, use it and encourage
    students to use it.

-   If you receive email or canvas notifications from students, answer
    them but redirect them in the future to Piazza. If the
    question/answer would be of benefit to the class as a whole, post
    the question/answer to Piazza and inform the student they can find
    the answer there.

-   For communications among instructor(s), CLs and LAs, use Piazza but
    make it a private message, viewable only to instructors or the
    individual(s) that it is intended for.

-   If a question has been asked/answered before, link to the original
    post as your answer.

-   Be professional in all your communications, be courteous and
    helpful.

-   Be prompt in answering communications. No question or email should
    go unanswered (or at least unacknowledged) for more than 24 business
    hours (business days, i.e. excluding weekends and holidays)

# Grading

## Timeline

-   Lab grading is (mostly) automated and will not be the responsibility
    of LAs.

-   Assignments and design document drafts are due on Fridays at
    midnight. Randomized grading assignments will be sent out prior to
    the due date/time. We will use a combination of

    -   Codepost: <https://codepost.io> - sign in using your email used
        in Canvas. This tool is used to leave detailed comments on
        submitted code.

    -   The webgrader, <https://cse-linux-01.unl.edu/~c-cbourke3/CSCE156/grade/>
        (use your Canvas credentials to login; URL may differ depending
        on course/section)

-   LAs should provide extensive line-by-line comments (including
    positive comments when appropriate) through codepost. Grade
    according to the provided rubric and in a consistent manner.

-   LAs are required to have completed their assigned grading by 5PM the
    following Tuesday (or within 48 business hours of the due date).
    Upon completion LAs should be available via Piazza and/or email for
    any issues that need to be resolved.

-   If LAs face any impediments or issues to completing their grading on
    time, they should discuss this with the instructor team as soon as
    possible. Course Leaders may be responsible for helping to resolve
    the issue by either temporarily helping with grading or shifting
    grading assignments.

-   CLs should have everything reviewed and any issues resolved by 5PM
    the following Thursday at which time grades will be released to
    students.

## Directives

-   Grade in accordance to the rubric. If the rubric does not address
    something or there is a *reasonable* uncertainty, discuss it with
    the instruction team.

-   Grade in a consistent manner, both between individual assignments
    and with other graders. There should not be a significant variation
    in points deducted or awarded for similar mistakes or work.
    Consistency and grading quality will be checked by your CL
    supervisor.

-   When you deduct points, give clear and reasonably detailed reasons
    and justifications for doing so. Good feedback is essential for the
    students' learning experience. Put in efforts to provide
    constructive feedback and positive feedback for good work.

-   Be professional, positive and encouraging regardless of how well the
    student did. Include comments for any changes or other
    administrative items (corrections, regrades, etc.).

-   In general, unless otherwise stated, the formatting of output is
    left up to the student. As long as output formatting is reasonable
    and conveys *just as much* information as the expected output, it
    should be graded as correct.

## Checklist

The following is a list of items that should have been provided to the
instructor and/or collected by the Learning Assistant program as well as
a checklist of administrative items necessary for all CLs and LAs.

-   An appropriate photo to be used on the canvas instructors page so
    that students can easily identify you

-   A short bio to be included in the canvas instructors page

-   Your NUID

-   Your availability for each lab section so the instructor can assign
    you to to particular lab section(s)

-   Your availability for weekly coordinating meetings (all Course
    Leaders are required to attend)

-   Establish weekly office hours

# Vigilance

-   Be on the lookout for improvements to policies, processes, grading,
    course material, etc. I welcome any and all feedback and would
    appreciate it.

-   Be on the lookout for suspected academic integrity violations, odd
    code idiosyncrasies or patterns not covered in class, similarities
    in code, disparate performance in class/lab and grades received,
    etc. However, never confront a student directly. Bring your concerns
    to the instructor and be sure to document everything.

-   Be on the lookout for racial, gender, or other biases or incidents.
    It is essential that we promote an open and equitable environment
    for everyone. If you see a potential issue or event, please
    intervene and correct it immediately. Report incidences to the
    instructor as soon as possible.
