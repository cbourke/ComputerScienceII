### Creating and Designing Classes: Reflection & Demo

* Java is a "class"-based object oriented programming language
* Everything in Java is a class or belongs to a class
* A `class` in Java:
  * allows you to model a "real world" object or idea or "entity"
  * allows you to *group* multiple pieces of data together into one logical unit
  * also allows you to *encapsulate* methods within the class that *act on* or *operate on* that class's data (ie functionality)
  * IE: it allows you to group functionality together with the data that it operates on
  * Java classes also allow you to *protect* data from outside of the class
* First demonstration: design a class that models a radioactive isotope
