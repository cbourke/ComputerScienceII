# Lists & List-based Data Structures
## CSCE 156 - Spring 2023

### Introduction/Overview

* Motivation: dynamic data structures (lists, sets, maps) are *way* better than simple arrays
* Leverages OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism)

### Arrays are "Bad"

* Once created, the size is essentially fixed
* We have to do a lot of bookkeeping to keep track of which indices have been "used" and which are free
* Deleting or removing elements may leave "gaps"

* Solution: creating a dynamic list:
  * Automatically grow/shrink without us having to worry about the details
  * Functionality:
    * Add things
    * Retrieve things
    * Remove things
    * Modify things
  * We want all the details to be *encapsulated* inside the data structure and not have to worry about them
  * We want an abstraction: an interface that specifies how to *use* the list, not necessarily how it works
