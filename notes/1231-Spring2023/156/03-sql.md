# Databases & SQL
## CSCE 156 - Spring 2023

### Introduction/Overview

* Flat data files are insufficient for storing data
  * Repetition of data
  * Formatting issues
  * Consistency issues: data anomalies
  * Integrity issues
  * Organization problems: not sorted, it is in one big file (no multithreaded or multiuser capability)
  * There is no security!

### Solution: use a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

* 1970 Edgar Codd
* Key aspects: data is stored in separate tables
* Tables have columns (pieces of data) and rows (records)
* Columns have a *type* and a *name* aka fields
* Each row in a table corresponds to a single record
* Records in different tables are *related* to each other through *foreign keys*
* Records within a table are uniquely identified by *primary keys*
* Foreign keys define relations between tables:
  * One-to-many relation: one records in table $A$ may be related to many records in table $B$
  * Many-to-one: same, but from hte perspective of $B$
  * Many-to-many relation: one record in table $A$ can be related to many records in table $B$ and vice versa

## CRUD Demonstration

* You can interact with a RDBMS through CRUD:
    * Create (`insert`)
    * Retrieve (`select`)
    * Update (`update`)
    * Destroy (`delete`)

```sql

select * from platform;
select * from game;
select * from publisher;

-- insert a new record for the publisher "Naughty Dog"

insert into publisher (name) values ("Naughty Dog");
-- you can, but should not specify primary keys:
insert into publisher (publisherId,name) values (20, "Naughty Dog");

-- remove the duplicate entry for Naughty Dog

-- bad, but safe mode prevents you from deleting everything in the table
delete from publisher;


-- delete an entire table:
-- drop table publisher;

-- safely delete ONE record using a WHERE clause:

delete from publisher where publisherId = 20;

-- hardcode a FK (foreign key):
insert into game (name, publisherId) values ("The Last of Us", 14);


-- OR you can use a "nested" loop:
insert into game (name, publisherId) values ("The Last of Us",
  (select publisherId from publisher where name = "Naughty Dog") );

insert into game (gameId, name, publisherId) values (100, "Uncharted", 14);

insert into game (name, publisherId) values
  ("Uncharted 2", 14),
  ("The Last of Us 2", 14);

insert into game (name, publisherId) values ("Crash Bandikoot", 14);

-- update my misspelling:

update game set name = "Crash Bandicoot" where gameId = 103;

```

### Observations

* Comments are usually denoted with a `--` (two hyphens)
* Be consistent on table name and column name conventions; suggestion:
  * `TableName`s are upper camel cased (NOT plural)
  * `columnName`s are lower camel cased
* In old-school SQL, keywords are `ALLCAPS`, you can use this convention, but why?
  * SQL keywords are case *insensitive*
  * The old-school way assumed a monochrome monitor
* Whitespace generally does not matter, you can go to the next line and break up long lines to make it more readable
* If you do, align things using proper indentation
* You can use either double quotes or single quotes to denote strings, but be consistent
* Every query ends with a semicolon `;`

## Retrieving Data

* You can pull data out of a database using the `select` statement
* To pull every single record and every single column value you can use a wildcard:

```sql

select * from game;

-- you can be more specific on which columns by specifying them:
select name,publisherId from game;
select name from game;

-- you can use aliasing of column names
select name as gameTitle from game;
```

## More Fancy Select statements

* You can use *aggregate* functions to compute results on the SQL server itself

```sql

-- how many game titles do we have in our database?
select count(*) as numberOfTitles from game;

-- you can specify more fine-grained data/queries using a where clause:
select * from game where name = "GTA 2";
select count(*) from game where name = "GTA 2";
select * from game where publisherId = 1;
select * from game where publisherId = 1 or name = "GTA 2";
select * from game where publisherId = 1 and name = "GTA 2";
select * from game where (publisherId > 3 and publisherId < 7)
  or name = "GTA 2";

-- other aggregate functions:
-- what is the oldest game?
select max(publishYear) from availability;
select min(publishYear) from availability;
select avg(publishYear) from availability;
select 10 * min(publishYear) + 3 as someNumber from availability;


-- you can do partial string matching:
select * from game where name like "G%";
select * from game where name like "G%";
select * from game where name like "%G%";
select * from game where name like "g%";
select * from game where name like "%t%";

-- You can match any single character using the underscore:
select * from game where name like "_a%";
select * from game where name like "___a%";

```

## `order by` clause

* In general the results you get back from a database are unordered
* you can sort the results by any column using `order by`
* Default: ascending order

```sql
select * from availability order by publishYear;
select * from availability order by publishYear asc;
select * from availability order by publishYear desc;
-- string order:
select * from game order by name;
-- order first by publisher then by name:
select * from game order by publisherId, name;
select * from game order by publisherId desc, name asc;
```

## Distinct

* You can use `distinct` to only get unique values: `select distinct publisherId from game;`

## `in` clause

* Sometimes you can treat a result as a *set*

```sql

select * from game where gameId = 1 or gameId = 5 or gameId = 9;
-- using the in clause:
select * from game where gameId in (1, 5, 9);
-- allows you to use a *subquery* to pull more data
select publisherId from publisher where name = "LucasArts";
select * from game where publisherId = 1;
select * from game where publisherId in
  (select publisherId from publisher where name ="LucasArts" or name = "Nintendo");

select * from game where publisherId in
  (select publisherId from publisher where
   name in ("LucasArts", "Nintendo"));
```

## Data Projections

* You can "project" data with multiple "dimensions" (columns) down to lower dimensions (fewer columns) and *aggregate* the data to produce more information
* Example: how many games has each publisher published?

```sql

select * from game;

-- restrict to only games that begin with a "G":
select * from game where name like "G%";

select publisherId, count(*) as numberOfGames
  from game
  where name like "G%"
  group by publisherId;


select publisherId, count(*) as numberOfGames
  from game
  group by publisherId
  having numberOfGames >= 2;

select publisherId, count(*) as numberOfGames
  from game
  where name like "Z%"
  group by publisherId
  having numberOfGames >= 2;

```

Let $A, B$ be sets:
  $$A = \{a, b, c\}, B = \{1, 2\}$$

$$A \times B = \{(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1), (b, 2), (c, 1), (c, 2)\}$$

$$\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$$

* What is the cardinality (size) of $A$?  $|A| = 3$
* What is the cardinality (size) of $B$?  $|B| = 2$
* What is the cardinality (size) of $A\times B$?  $|A\times B| = 6$
* In general, if you have $|A| = n$, $|B| = m$, what is the cardinality of $|A \times B| = n \cdot m$

```sql

select count(*) from game;
select count(*) from publisher;
select * from publisher;

select 22 * 17;

-- naive cross join/cartesian product:
select * from game join publisher;

-- you only join ON the publisherId:
select * from game g join publisher p
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId;

-- only select the columns you are interested in:  
select g.name as gameTitle, p.name as publisherName
  from game g join publisher p
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId;

  -- gives a good report but does not include any
  -- publishers with zero games...
select p.name as publisherName, count(g.gameId)
  from game g join publisher p
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by g.publisherId;

select p.name as publisherName, count(g.gameId)
  from publisher p join game g
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by g.publisherId;

select p.name as publisherName, count(g.gameId)
  from publisher p join game g
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by g.publisherId;

-- preserve records from the left table
select *
  from publisher p left join game g
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId;

-- preserves records from the left table and
-- treats NULL values as zero
-- this one is wrong because you don't want to count the row, but the gameId:
select p.name as publisherName, count(*)
  from publisher p left join game g
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by p.publisherId;

select p.name as publisherName, count(g.gameId)
  from publisher p left join game g
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by p.publisherId;

select p.name as publisherName, count(g.gameId)
  from game g right join publisher p
  on g.publisherId = p.publisherId
  group by p.publisherId;

-- create a query to "flatten" the entire database:
-- ie produce a CSV-like file

use cbourke;

-- a single query to dump all of the data to one "flat" representation
select *
  from publisher p
  left join game g on p.publisherId = g.publisherId
  left join availability a on a.gameId = g.gameId
  left join platform plat on plat.platformId = a.platformId
union
select *
  from publisher p
  right join game g on p.publisherId = g.publisherId
  right join availability a on a.gameId = g.gameId
  right join platform plat on plat.platformId = a.platformId;

```

## Designing & Implementing a Database

* Demonstration: create a database to model the account (annuity, savings account)
  application.  Allow accounts to be owned by multiple people

```sql

drop table if exists Email;
drop table if exists Ownership;
drop table if exists Person;
drop table if exists Account;

create table if not exists Person (
  personId int primary key not null auto_increment,
  -- TODO: allowed to be null?
  firstName varchar(255),
  lastName varchar(255) not null,
  dateOfBirth varchar(10) not null default "0000-00-00"
);

create table if not exists Email (
  emailId int primary key not null auto_increment,
  address varchar(255) not null,
  personId int not null,
  foreign key (personId) references Person(personId)
);

create table if not exists Account (
  accountId int primary key not null auto_increment,
  accountNumber varchar(255) not null unique key,
  -- S = Savings, A = Annuity
  type varchar(1) not null,
  monthlyPayment double,
  termYears int,
  balance double,
  apr double, -- [0, 1]
  constraint `aprIsValid` check (apr >= 0 and apr <= 1)
);

create table if not exists Ownership (
  ownershipId int primary key not null auto_increment,
  personId int not null,
  accountId int not null,
  foreign key (personId) references Person(personId),
  foreign key (accountId) references Account(accountId),
  constraint `uniquePair` unique (personId,accountId)
);


```

### Observations

* Semantics dictate design: usually you have one table per "entity"
* Style tips:
  * Be consistent with naming
  * Suggestion:
    * Tables should have an `UpperCamelCasing` convention
    * Columns should have a `lowerCamelCasing` convention
    * Avoid pluralizations and abbreviations
  * Make sure every table has a primary key
    * `int not null auto_increment`
    * Use `tableName + Id`, `personId, emailId`
  * Foreign keys should have the *same name* as the primary keys that they reference
  * Strings (`varchar`s) should not be used for PK or FK (casting issues, encoding issues, efficiency)
  * Join tables should be used to model a many-to-many relationship
  * Be sure to insert plenty of test data into your database
  * Check and uniqueness constraints can be used to enforce *data integrity*

## Normalization

* 1-NF, 2-NF, 3-NF
* They build on each other: you cannot have a higher normal form without having ALL lower normal forms
* First Normal Form: "each attribute in a table only has atomic values"
  * Each column represents only ONE piece of data, ONE value
  * Violation: stored a comma delimited list of emails in the `Person` table instead of a separate table
  * Violation: having columns `email1, email2, email3`
  * Be sure to separate data out into separate tables as necessary
* Second normal form: it has to be 1-NF: no non-prime attribute is dependent on a proper subset of prime attributes
  * Using a PK auto-generated, not null gets you 2-NF automatically!
  * Violation: a purchase record that contains `customerId, storeId, storeAddress`
  * If the PK is a combination of `customerId/storeId` the `storeAddress` is only dependent on the second part
  * It is often useful and necessary to define combination keys, but *keep them secondary*!
  * You split everything out into its own table
* Third Normal form: has to be 2-NF (and transitively 1-NF)
  * No non-prime column is transitively dependent on the key
  * Example: storing `termYears, monthlyPayment` for an annuity account but ALSO storing the `value` (`termYears * monthlyPayment * 12` )
  * Storing data that is dependent on other data is *wrong*
  * It gives a failure point: it introduces a possible data anomaly (if one value changes then the other value(s) may need to do so as well)
* Every non-key attribute must provide a fact about the key (1NF), the whole key (2NF) and nothing but the key (3NF) so help you Codd

## Misc

* There is a LOT more
  * Triggers, Views, Stored Procedures, Variables, etc
  * Transactions: all or nothing series of queries
  * Security issues: do not store sensitive info in a database unhashed/unencrypted:
  * Soft vs Hard deletes: a hard delete is a result of a `delete` statement.  A soft delete involves defining a boolean column `isActive` that is true if the record is active, false if it is "deleted"
  * OOP Model vs Relational Model
    * OOP model allows *inheritance*
    * RDBMs do not have inheritance
    * You need a way to resolve the difference in these two models
    * You can create a table per class/subclass
    * Single table inheritance strategy: one table represents all subtypes and you use a *discriminator* column to tell difference
    * you use a string to indicate the subtype of the class.  
    * Some columns may be relevant to some subtypes, others may irrelevant; simply allow them to be null to model this

## Programmatically Connecting to a Database & Processing Data

* In Java we'll use JDBC = Java Database Connectivity API (Application Programmer Interface)
* Getting Started:
  * Download and "install" the Connector/J jar file for MySQL

### Overview

* Goal: programmatically connect to a database and process or persist (save) data
* Most languages have some support for *database connectivity*
* Java: JDBC = Java DataBase Connectivity API
* API = Application Programmer Interface
* Perfect illustration/use of Dependency Inversion: you do not write code that connects to MySQL, you write code that interacts with an API
* JDBC:
  * `Connection`
  * `PreparedStatement`
  * `ResultSet`
* Vendors (Oracle, IBM, etc.) provide a *driver* library that conforms to the API
* ORMs (Object-Relational Mappings) systems also exist (JPA, jOOQ)

### Process

1. Create a connection to your database: need user name, password, URL
2. Create/prepare your query
  - prepare the query
  - execute the query
3. Process your results
4. Close your resources

## Best Practices

### Avoid the star operator

* Using the star operator: `select * ...` is okay when using MySQL Workbench (debugging/development/etc)
* In a real system you should not pull all of the data unless you are going to use it!
* Be intentional: specify the columns you want and ONLY those columns (even if it is all of them)
* It also future proofs you: some DBA could change the data model and our code may then be pulling data it does not use

### Security Issues

* For this course ONLY we are storing passwords in plaintext in a Java source file
* This is actually (unfortunately) common
* In practice:
  * You define a password-less "data source"
  * Don't use passwords at and shut off or control access at the network level (firewalling)

### Close Your Resources!

* Failure to close your resources wastes them
* You may *runout* of connections!
* make sure to close them in the proper order

### Dealing with `SQLExceptions`


* Unfortunately most operations throw a checked `SQLException` that *has* to be caught and dealt with
* Just catch and release: rethrow the exception as a `RuntimeExcpeion`
* You *may* even want to log the error *then* rethrow it
* If you do do logging, then use a proper library; `System.out` or `System.err` are not proper logging libraries!
* Solution: use a logging library such as log4j

### Always Use `PreparedStatements`

* In general, strings can contain anything including SQL code!
* Without sanitizing your code, you are susceptible to an *SQL Injection* attack: a user *may* be able to execute arbitrary SQL code on your database!
* `PreparedStatement`s in Java *sanitize* the inputs for you, ensuring that no SQL injection is possible
* Never use anything else!
* Its just simpler to use on method to connect to a database
