### Object Oriented Programming

## Objects

### Creating and Designing Classes: Demo

* Java is a "class"-based object oriented programming language
* Everything in Java is a class or belongs to a class
* A `class` in Java:
  * allows you to model a "real world" object or idea or "entity"
  * allows you to *group* multiple pieces of data together into one logical unit
  * also allows you to *encapsulate* methods within the class that *act on* or *operate on* that class's data (ie functionality)
  * IE: it allows you to group functionality together with the data that it operates on
  * Java classes also allow you to *protect* data from outside of the class
* First demonstration: design a class that models a radioactive isotope

## Objects

* Formally an object is a general entity characterized by:
1. Identity: an aspect of the object that distinguishes it from all other instances
2. State: a collection of properties (elements, attributes, data, fields, *member variables*)
3. Behavior: the functionality of the object or what it *does* or the services it provides

* Generally objects/classes should adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle**: they should one thing and that one thing they should do well.
* Communication between objects is done by "message sending": you invoke a method on an object and the object/class is responsible for the behavior
  * Bad Encapsulation (breaking encapsulation): locating methods that act on the data in a class outside of the class
* Communication is facilitated through an object's *interface*: its `public`-facing methods or variables
* Objects are *constructed* rather than just assigned
  * In Java, by default a no-argument constructor is provided
  * If you define your OWN constructor, it goes away
  * You can always restore it by explicitly defining it
  * You can define as many constructors as you wish to make your objects more usable
* Common patterns:
  * Copy constructors that take another instance of the object and make a deep copy
  * Partial copy constructors: copy constructors that take an object and other values to make a (partial) copy of the object
* Object design:
  * "Semantics dictate design"
  * Careful: YAGNI = You Ain't Gonna Need It (don't overdesign)
  * You break real-world objects or ideas into smaller and smaller parts until...
    * It is directly representable OR
    * An object already exists for it
* Generally objects are *composed* of other objects; this is known as "composition"
  * One object "owns" an instance of another object
* Patterns: are good practices to follow when creating objects
* Anti-patterns: bad habits to get into
* Example: "god anti-pattern": if you design a class that knows everything (has all the variables) does everything (has all the methods) and is everything (there is only one class), then it is the "god class"

## Four Pillars:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

## Abstraction

* Abstraction is implementation or "information hiding"
* Review: procedural abstraction: How does `Math.sqrt()` work?  Who cares?
* The details of an implementation or representation of an object are abstracted away inside the class
  * How does Java represent a `String`?
  * How does Java represent a `LocalDate`?
    * 3 integers: year/month/day
    * String: ISO 8601 standard
    * A single number: number of milliseconds since an epoch (unix epoch: Jan 1, 1970)
    * Answer: who cares?

## Encapsulation

Strong encapsulation is comprised of three things:
1. The grouping of data into one logical unit
2. The protection of data from the outside world
3. The grouping of methods (behavior) that act on that data

* Don't break encapsulation by locating data or methods that act on that data outside the class
* Bank stuff belongs in the `Bank` class, not the `main` or `Demo` class, not the `Isotope` class
* Student "stuff" belongs in the `Student` class
* Good abstraction and encapsulation work together to make code:
  * Isolated
  * More easily testable
  * Control/limit "side effects"
  * Reusable

## Inheritance

* Inheritance allows you to reuse a class by `extends`ing it and creating a *subclass*
  * Common functionality and state/behavior is located in the `super` class
  * Specific behavior/specialization is provided or *overridden* in the subclass
  * Example: Animal, Dog, Cat

Demonstration: draft a collection of financial asset classes
  * Savings Account: an account that pays *interest* on a *balance* monthly
  * Annuity: a product that pays a fixed monthly amount over a certain number of years
