## Introduction

* Data *structures* are good because *structure* can be exploited for efficient operations
* Motivation: want a data structure that supports efficient:
  * Retrieval/search
  * Insertion
  * Deletion
* Linked Lists:
  * Insertion/delete from the head or tail: $O(1)$
  * Arbitrary insertion/index-based search: $O(n)$
* Array-based lists:
  * Arbitrary index-based search: $O(1)$
  * If sorted, you can also use binary search for fast arbitrary element search (key-based)
  * Inserting/deleting from the start: $O(n)$
* Stacks/Queues:
  * ALL operations are *always* efficient
  * BUT: they were *restricted access* data structures
  * All operations are $O(1)$ but we cannot do arbitrary CRUD
* Ultimate goal: efficient operations for a *general purpose* collection data structure
* Trees provide a *potential* for efficient operations!
