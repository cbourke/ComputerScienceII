### Object Oriented Programming

## Creating and Designing Classes: Reflection & Demo

* Java is a "class"-based object oriented programming language
* Everything in Java is a class or belongs to a class
* A `class` in Java allows you to model a "real world" object or idea or "entity"

## Objects

Formally an object is a general entity characterized by:

1. Identity: an aspect of the object that distinguishes it from all other instances
2. State: a collection of properties (elements, attributes, data, fields, *member variables*)
3. Behavior: the functionality that acts on the object's state/data: what the object does or what services it provides: its methods

* Identity is achieved in Java by generating the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods
* Communication between objects is done via "message sending": just a fancy way of saying an object's functions are invoked or called
* Communication is facilitated by the object's *interface*: the `public` methods that are available
  * `private` methods may be useful, but are *not* part of the interface
* Objects are *constructed* rather than just assigned
  * In Java, constructor methods are named after the class; the have no return value, and can take any number of parameters
  * If you do not define a constructor, a no-argument (no parameter) default constructor is provided by Java
  * If you do define a constructor, the default goes away; you an always explicitly define it
  * You can have as many constructors as you want
  * Useful pattern: copy constructors
* Common patterns:
  * DRY Principle = Don't Repeat Yourself!
  * YAGNI = You Ain't Gonna Need It (don't over engineer your classes)
  * KISS = Keep It Simple, (i said) SIMPLE!
