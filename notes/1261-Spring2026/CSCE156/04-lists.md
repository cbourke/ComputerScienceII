# Lists & List-based Data Structures
## CSCE 156 - Spring 2026

### Introduction/Overview

* Motivation: dynamic data structures (lists, sets, maps) are *way* better than simple arrays
* Leverages OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism)

### Arrays are "Bad"

```java
int arr[] = new int[10];
```

* once they are created, the size is *FIXED*: it cannot be changed
* We have to do a lot of bookkeeping to keep track of which indices have been "used" and which are free
* Deleting or removing elements may leave "gaps"

Solution: design and implement a dynamic list data structure

* Automatically resizes (grows/shrinks) based on the elements you insert, add, or delete (we don't have to worry about the details: abstraction/encapsulation)
* Functionality:
  * C = create: add things, insert things into the list
  * R = retrieve: get an element
  * U = Update: remove/add an element or modify an element
  * D = Delete: remove elements from the list
* All of the details are going to be encapsulated inside the data structure
* We only want to use the data structure *abstractly*

## Array-based lists

* Design the *interface* (the `public` methods) first
* Design the *tests* next (TDD = Test Driven Development)
* Implement the interface
* Update design, tests, implementation as you go along
