### Object Oriented Programming

## Creating and Designing Classes: Reflection & Demo

* Java is a "class"-based object oriented programming language
* Everything in Java is a class or belongs to a class
* A `class` in Java allows you to model a "real world" object or idea or "entity"

## Objects

Formally an object is a general entity characterized by:

1. Identity: an aspect of the object that distinguishes it from all other instances
2. State: a collection of properties (elements, attributes, data, fields, *member variables*)
3. Behavior: the functionality that acts on the object's state/data: what the object does or what services it provides: its methods
