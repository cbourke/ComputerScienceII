"""
A class and module to support an entire course.  A
course is connected to both a Canvas course as well
as a CSE course account.

This module loads data from the Canvas course using
its API (see canvas.py) and then interfaces with the
CSE User Database (see udb.py) to connect users with
their CSE logins.

Using the configuration module (see config.py), users
are separated according to instructors (non-graders),
graders, and students.  If a user cannot be connected
to a CSE login, they are separated into an "orphan"
group.

The Course class itself maintains these groups both
as lists of NUIDs (strings) and maps of NUID => Person (object).

When used as an executable file, all course data is
loaded and printed to the standard output.  Otherwise,
a global object (course) is made available.

In addition to the course data, two functions provide
functionality to randomly create a grading assignment
(see getAssignment() and assignmentToString()).
