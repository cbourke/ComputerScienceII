class Person:
    """
    A class that models a person which includes students,
    graders, instructors, etc.

    Each person is uniquely identified by their NUID and
    is expected to have credentials Canvas.

    For students, their email is usually their huskers email.

    Separate name elements (first, last) may not be available in
    Canvas and instead only a 'display' name may be available due
    to students being able to set a 'preferred name' in the
    registration system.  Generally this should be sufficient
    for lexicographic ordering.
